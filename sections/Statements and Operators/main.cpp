Quiz 1: The ________ operator increments the value of its operand by one then uses the value.
Prefix increment.

Quiz 2: The operator used to test two operands for equality is ________.
==

Quiz 3: The operator that represents logical AND is ________.
&&

||

Quiz 5: If a is 3, b is 5, and c is 7, which of the following are true?
b == 5;             // true
c == (a + b) â€“ 1;   // true
b > 5;              // false
a >= 3;             // true
c <= (a * b) / a;   // false

Quiz 6: a < 10  is called a(n) ________.
Relational expression.

Quiz 7: What will the following code display?
int x = 10, y = 3, z = 6;
cout << (x == y) << " ";
cout << (z <= x) << " ";
cout << (y != z) << " ";

0 1 1 1 1 0

Quiz 8: What is displayed by the following code?
int amount = 100;
amount += amount * 2;
cout << amount << endl;

300

Quiz 9: What is displayed by the following code?
int x= 5;
int y= -2;
int z = 2;
cout << (x + y * z <= x + z * z - x) << endl;

1 because 1 <= 4 is true.

Quiz 10: What are the values of x, y and z after the following code executes?
double  a = 100;
int b = 12;
int x = b % 3;
double  y = a / b;
